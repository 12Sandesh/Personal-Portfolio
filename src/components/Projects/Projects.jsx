It captures images of hand gestures from a webcam, crops them, and resizes them for training a custom Keras model called 'Teras'. The trained model then recognizes sign language in real-time by analyzing hand gestures captured from the webcam. The system translates these gestures into text or spoken language, enabling communication through sign language."
